    <h1> The relationship between perceptable color differences and euclidean distances in the CIELab color space</h1>

      <h3> Introduction </h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of this study was to investigate the CIE LAB space and see how the metric for just noticable difference affects how quickly humans notice differences. We are trying to see if there is a point at which just noticeable differences (JND) or the euclidean distance between colors in the CIE LAB space simply do not matter anymore, that JNDs above a certain number or under certain conditions, have no affect on how quickly we recognize color differences. 

        In essence, color pallettes optimizaed for maximum JNDs are often awful, when we create color pallettes, how different do we really need make colors in a color pallette?

      <h3> Methodolgy</h3>
        <p>Participants of the study were shown series of images that looked like the following:</p>
        <br>
        <table class='table-bordered' style="width:70%">
        <tr>
          <td>fig.1</td>
          <td>fig.2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><img src='dot.png' width='400' height = '300'></td>
          <td><img src='example.png' width='400' height = '300'></td>
        </tr>
        </table>
        <p> They would first be presented fig.1 and was instructud to click on the center dot, at which point fig.2 was immediately rendered. Then they were asked to click on the sector that differed in color in fig.2 as fast as possible and we measured the time taken between fig.2 being rendered and the moues click on the sector. We also captured whether or not a participant clicked on the correct sector. </p>

        <p> The first ten rings of colors we showed the participants were controls that looked like the following,<p>
        <table class='table-bordered'>
        <tr><td>
        <img src='control.png' width='400' height='300'>
        </td></tr>
        </table>
        <p> These were used to approximate the fastest time a user can recognize a color difference, and move the mouse cursor over the desired sector and click.</p>
